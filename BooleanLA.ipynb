    "We need to setup a couple of things before defining our classes. `%run 'svg.ipynb'` imports a variety of HTML svg tags which we will use to construct our diagrams. These are just strings which we can input values into using python's str.format(). Next, itertools.combinations is imported which we use to map out a cross product from a set which will then be used for evaluating relations. The `space` variable holds a padding value which will space out each node in the diagram. And lastly, when a set is provided in the Main.ipynb, it can either be a set of sets, integers, or strings. The set's nodes are then stored and assigned a key equal to the node's value. In the case of integers and strings this works just fine. If a set of sets is provided, we can't use it to key each node (can't use lists as keys for dicts in python). validate(s) rids us of this problem, and now we can go onto defining our classes.\n",
